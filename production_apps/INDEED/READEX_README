This directory contains parts of the files required to
build and run the Indeed code for READEX.
It does not contain the Indeed source code itself. 
This code can be found on Taurus at $PROJECT/Indeed_for_readex/src.
In order to start working with Indeed, it is necessary to merge 
that directory with this current one.

The "readex_env" subdirectory is a symbolic link to the
"env/intelmpi2017.2.174_intel2017.2.174" subdirectory of
the global READEX apps directory.

In the main directory, the user can find the "compile_for_*.sh"
scripts that are required to build the various versions of Indeed.
They can be simply passed to sbatch.

The "testdata" directory contains thre typical data sets that 
can be used for testing. The datasets are of different sizes: 
* small ("H1N")
* medium ("B1")
* large ("SBC")

The "scripts" subdirectory contains the scripts that are required
to run Indeed. For each test case (plain, saf, rdd, etc.) there is
a script called "run_*.sh" which sets some environment variables
and then submits the associated "submit_*.sbatch" script to SLURM
via sbatch, thus initiating the Indeed test tun. The "run_*.sh"
script should be called from the shell with the command 
    run_XXX.sh exampleID name@email.address
where exampleID may be either H1N, B1 or SBC. This parameter defines
which of the example datasets will be used. The second parameter is
an email address. It is optional and may thus be omitted. If it is
given then SLURM will send an email notification of the job start
and end to this address; if it is not given then no such email will
be sent. The process is organized in such a way that the input deck
for Indeed is copied to the scratch file system, and the job is then 
run there. After completion, the entire file collection (input and 
output decks, including the READEX results) is copied back to the
"testdata" directory where it is placed in a subdirectory named
"Job_NNN" with "NNN" being the SLURM job id.
